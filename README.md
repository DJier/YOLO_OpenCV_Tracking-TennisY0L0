# 🎾 Tennis Match Analysis & Visualization

This project uses deep learning and computer vision to **analyze tennis match videos**. It tracks players and the ball, detects key events, calculates advanced metrics (like shot speed and player speed), and renders a final video with real-time visual overlays.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🎯 **Player & Ball Detection** using YOLOv8 and custom-trained YOLOv5
- 🧠 **Court Line Detection** with keypoint regression model
- 📍 **Mini Court Visualization** to map actual player and ball positions
- ⚡ **Shot Speed Calculation** (in km/h)
- 🏃 **Player Movement Tracking**
- 📊 **Statistical Overlays** (live on video)
- 💾 **Detection Caching** using pickle stubs for faster debugging

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Djier/tennis-match-analysis.git
cd tennis-match-analysis
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare Models
- Place your **YOLOv8 model** (for players) inside the root or pass the model path.
- Place the **YOLOv5 ball detection model** at: `models/last.pt`
- Place the **court keypoint regression model** at: `models/keypoints_model.pth`

### 4. Add Your Video
Drop your match video at:
```
input_videos/input_video.mp4
```

### 5. Run the Pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```
